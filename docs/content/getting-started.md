# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Hoverkraft Docusaurus Theme**! This is a strictly opinionated theme that enforces consistent Hoverkraft branding across all documentation projects.

## Overview

The Hoverkraft theme is designed with an **opinionated philosophy** that:

- ðŸŽ¨ **Enforces Hoverkraft branding** with fixed colors, typography, and layout
- ðŸ“± **Provides responsive design** that works on all device sizes
- âš¡ **Requires zero configuration** - just install and use
- ðŸ§© **Includes standardized components** with consistent styling
- ðŸ”§ **Maintains brand consistency** across all Hoverkraft projects

## Opinionated Design Philosophy

This theme intentionally **removes customization options** to ensure:

- **Brand Consistency**: Every Hoverkraft documentation site looks professional and consistent
- **Reduced Complexity**: No configuration means faster setup and fewer ways to break
- **Quality Standards**: Enforced design patterns and accessibility best practices
- **Team Efficiency**: Focus on content, not design decisions

## What's Included

### Core Components

- **Layout**: Standardized page wrapper with Hoverkraft header and footer
- **Footer**: Professional multi-section footer with company information
- **Logo**: Fixed "Hoverkraft" text branding (no custom logos allowed)

### Fixed Design System

- **Official Branding**: Colors, typography, and layout from the [Hoverkraft Branding Guidelines](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/branding) - **not customizable**
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first design approach
- **CSS Variables**: Internal use only - **not exposed for customization**

For complete branding specifications including color values, typography scales, and design principles, refer to the [Hoverkraft Branding Repository](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/branding).

### Development Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions
- **Minimal Configuration**: No theme-specific options required
- **Hot Reloading**: Development-friendly setup
- **Standard Docusaurus**: Full compatibility with all Docusaurus features

## Next Steps

1. [**Install the theme**](./installation) in your Docusaurus project
2. **Start building** - no configuration required!
3. Explore the [**component documentation**](./components/layout) for reference

## Live Demo

This documentation site itself is built using the Hoverkraft theme, demonstrating the enforced branding and professional appearance!

## Why Opinionated?

By removing customization options, this theme ensures that:

- All Hoverkraft documentation maintains a **consistent professional appearance**
- Teams can **focus on content creation** rather than design decisions
- **Brand recognition** is maintained across all Hoverkraft properties
- **Setup time is minimized** - no complex configuration needed

The result is a cohesive ecosystem of documentation that looks and feels distinctly Hoverkraft.
